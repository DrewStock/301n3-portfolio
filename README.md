# Portfolio of Drew Stock
==================================================
This portfolio represents my web development work and is an ongoing project in the [Code 301:Intermediate Software Development] (https://www.codefellows.org/courses/code-301/intermediate-software-development/) course that I'm currently enrolled in at the Portland, OR campus of [Code Fellows] (https://www.codefellows.org/). As the course progresses, I'll be updating my portfolio to incorporate the coding languages, frameworks and processes that I'm learning about.
