The app was inspired by Cascasdes Pika Watch, a program sponsored by the Oregon Zoo and the U.S. Geological Survey. This program crowdsources the collection of data on sightings of pikas, which are small wild rodents that live in the Columbia River Gorge. We wanted to make an app that crowdsources the tracking of common rodents in the Greater Portland Area. Rodent aficionados and beginners alike can enter their data, which includes prompts like the size of the rodent, and explains easily recognizable rodent features.</p>',
